# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@schoolmanagement.com

# Timezone for scheduled reports
TIMEZONE=UTC
```

### Dependencies Added
- `puppeteer` - PDF generation
- `exceljs` - Excel file generation
- `nodemailer` - Email sending
- `node-cron` - Task scheduling

## Database Tables

### scheduled_reports
Stores scheduled report configurations:
- Report parameters and filters
- Frequency and timing settings
- Recipient email addresses
- Active/inactive status

### report_history
Tracks all generated reports:
- Generation status and timestamps
- File information and download URLs
- Error logs for failed generations
- Links to scheduled reports

## Usage Examples

### 1. Export a Report to PDF
```javascript
POST /api/v1/reports/export/report-123?format=pdf
```

### 2. Create a Scheduled Weekly Report
```javascript
POST /api/v1/reports/scheduled
{
  "name": "Weekly Attendance Report",
  "reportType": "attendance",
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "format": "pdf",
  "recipients": ["admin@school.com", "principal@school.com"],
  "parameters": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31",
    "groupBy": "class"
  }
}
```

### 3. Email a Report
```javascript
POST /api/v1/reports/email/report-123
{
  "recipients": ["teacher@school.com"],
  "format": "excel",
  "message": "Please find the monthly academic report attached."
}
```

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for admins, staff, teachers
- **File Access Control**: Users can only download their own reports
- **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Processing**: All export operations are asynchronous
- **File Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old report files
- **Batch Processing**: Large datasets are processed in batches
- **Concurrent Limits**: Maximum concurrent export operations

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Export format validation
- File generation and cleanup
- Email functionality
- Scheduled report management
- Error handling and edge cases

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- src/tests/reportExport.test.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

- Chart generation in PDF/Excel exports
- Report templates and customization
- Real-time report generation status
- Integration with cloud storage services
- Advanced scheduling options (custom cron expressions)

## Task Completion

âœ… **Task 10.2: Implement report export functionality** has been completed with:

1. **PDF Export**: Full PDF generation with professional formatting
2. **Excel/CSV Export**: Structured data export for analysis
3. **Automated Report Scheduling**: Cron-based scheduling with email delivery
4. **Email Integration**: SMTP-based email delivery with attachments
5. **File Management**: Secure storage and access control
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: 22 test cases covering all functionality

The implementation provides a complete report export solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing school management system."
