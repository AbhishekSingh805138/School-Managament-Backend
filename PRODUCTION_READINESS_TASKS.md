## 🎯 **CURRENT FOCUS: Starting Phase 1 Execution**

### **Next Task to Execute**: 1.1.1 Debug and fix JWT token validation middleware

**Reason**: This is the root cause of 75 failing tests. All API endpoints return 401 Unauthorized even with valid tokens, making the entire system non-functional.

---

## 📋 **Task Execution Rules**
1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete tasks in order within each phase
2. **Testing Required**: Each task must pass tests before moving to next
3. **Documentation**: Update API docs after each major task
4. **Code Review**: Validate implementation against requirements
5. **No Skipping**: Don't move to Phase 2 until Phase 1 is 100% complete

---

## 🏆 **Success Criteria**
- **Phase 1 Complete**: >95% test pass rate, all core APIs working
- **Phase 2 Complete**: All business logic implemented and tested  
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Production deployment ready with monitoring

---

**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 1 execution
**Next Action**: Execute Task 1.1.1 - Fix JWT token validation middleware
